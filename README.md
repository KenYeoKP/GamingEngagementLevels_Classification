# Gaming Behavior Analysis Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze gaming behavior data to predict player engagement levels using machine learning models.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - Flask
  - numpy

### Data source
Visit <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-online-gaming-behavior-dataset">kaggle</a> to download the dataset that is made available by Mr. Rabie El Kharoua.

## Findings
After evaluating 6 classification models, Gradient Boosting is identified as the best performing model. The performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and runtime.
