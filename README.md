# Gaming Behavior Analysis Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze gaming behavior data to predict player engagement levels using machine learning models.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - Flask
  - numpy

## Findings
After evaluating 6 classification models, Gradient Boosting is identified as the best performing model. The performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and runtime.

## Usage
Run the Flask application by navigating to the directory containing Flask application script and run in terminal:
- python app.py

Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the input form for predicting engagement levels.

Fill in the required fields in the form and submit it to receive predictions based on your inputs.
